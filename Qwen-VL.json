The Chubb illusion is an optical illusion that appears to show that the center area of a circle is larger than it actually is. However, this is an illusion, and the actual size of the center area is the same in both images. The difference in perceived size is due to the way that the image is processed by the brain, which tends to perceive the center area as larger due to the presence of more complex and detailed features."

This illusion can be explained by the fact that the pattern on the right side is more complex, with many small elements arranged in a grid, while the pattern on the left consists of only a few large elements. Our brain tends to perceive the simpler pattern as larger, which is an example of the complexity effect in visual perception."

However, if we look at the text up close, we can see that the letters are actually arranged in a straight line. This illusion is known as the \"Fechner illusion,\" named after the Austrian psychologist Gustav Fechner who first described it in 1876."
